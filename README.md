# Kemal Demirgil Portfolio

### Description:
This is my first attempt on making a fully functional portfolio website. During the process, I've only used `HTML` and `CSS` and I've also used this oppurtunity to experiment the **display** element. Eventually, in the future, I'm planning to build a more interactive portfolio using JavaScript and JQuerry for improved UI.

### Issues:
- Too much repetitive code, I could've done it using variables and better element targeting.
- The website width needs adjustments, after a certain screen-size, the page gets extra white space on the right.
- Copyright text gets funky after a certain screen size.

### Improvements:
 >Since this is an example portfolio, I wanted to use it for practicing and gaining some experience with CSS and eventually, I need to fully be capable of controlling every elements position at all times and also discovering different usages of font styles could make a better display overall.
